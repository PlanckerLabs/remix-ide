In that case, the Editor's autocomplete features will not fully work until after the file is successfully compiled. After that, autocomplete will work even if there are errors, but only for the elements the Compiler already understands. For example, if you add a new function in a file that contains errors, autocomplete will not be able to find that function because it can’t compile the file."
